    "\n",
    "Beary's village is organizing a festival, and the village is laid out in a network of pathways connecting various key locations such as the main stage, food courts, and activity zones. These pathways need to be lit up for the festival, but the village has a limited number of lanterns. Beary decides to use his knowledge of approximation algorithms to efficiently light up the entire network, ensuring every pathway is illuminated by placing lanterns at strategic locations.\n",

    "### Vertex Cover Approximation Algorithm\n",
    "- Use a greedy algorithm to find an approximate solution to the Vertex Cover Problem.\n",
    "- The algorithm repeatedly picks the edge with the highest degree (most connections) and adds both endpoints to the vertex cover, then removes all edges incident to these vertices.\n",

    "1. Initialize an empty list for the vertex cover.\n",
    "2. While there are edges in the graph:\n",
    "    1. Pick an edge with the highest degree.\n",
    "    2. Add both endpoints of the edge to the vertex cover.\n",
    "    3. Remove all edges incident to these vertices.\n",
    "3. Return the list of vertices in the vertex cover.\n",

    "### Why Approximation Algorithm Works Here\n",
    "- The greedy approach works because it efficiently reduces the number of edges in each iteration by covering multiple edges at once, providing a near-optimal solution.\n"
