    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Beary is planning an adventure through a magical forest to collect different types of magical fruits for a grand feast. The forest is represented as a grid where each cell contains an integer, the number of fruits Beary can collect from that spot. However, there's a catch: the forest is enchanted, and some paths consume more energy than others. Your task is to help Beary find the path that maximizes the number of fruits collected while minimizing energy consumption, based on the path's time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function Signature:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def max_fruits(grid: List[List[int]], energy: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input\n",
    "- `grid`: A 2D list of integers representing the number of fruits in each cell.\n",
    "- `energy`: A 2D list of integers representing the energy required to move through each cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "- Returns an integer representing the maximum number of fruits that can be collected while minimizing energy consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "- The grid will have dimensions at most 50x50.\n",
    "- The values in `grid` and `energy` will be between 1 and 100.\n",
    "- There is at least one valid path for Beary to reach the destination.\n",

    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic Programming\n",
    "- Use dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently.\n",
    "- Create a DP table where each cell represents the maximum number of fruits that can be collected up to that cell.\n",
    "- Consider the energy cost to move from one cell to another and update the DP table accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "1. Initialize a DP table with the same dimensions as the grid.\n",
    "2. Set the starting point at the top-left corner of the grid.\n",
    "3. Iterate through the grid and update the DP table based on the maximum fruits that can be collected while considering the energy cost.\n",
    "4. Return the value at the bottom-right corner of the DP table as the result.\n"
