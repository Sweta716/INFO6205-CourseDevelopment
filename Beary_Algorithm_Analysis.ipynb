        "# Beary's Algorithm Analysis Adventure\n",
        "\n",
        "## Problem Description\n",
        "\n",
        "Beary is planning a grand adventure to explore the Enchanted Forest, which is filled with various treasures. The forest is represented as a grid, and each cell in the grid contains a certain number of treasures. However, moving through the forest requires energy, and each move (up, down, left, right) consumes one unit of energy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Beary wants to maximize the number of treasures he can collect while minimizing the energy consumption. Additionally, Beary is curious about the efficiency of his path-finding strategy. Your task is to help Beary analyze the time complexity of different paths he can take and determine the most efficient path.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Function Signature\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def analyze_treasures(grid: List[List[int]], energy: int) -> Tuple[int, str]:\n",
        "    pass\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Input\n",
        "\n",
        "- `grid`: A 2D list of integers representing the number of treasures in each cell. If a cell contains 0, it means there are no treasures there.\n",
        "- `energy`: An integer representing the total energy Beary has for his adventure.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Output\n",
        "\n",
        "- Returns a tuple where the first element is an integer representing the maximum number of treasures Beary can collect, and the second element is a string representing the Big-O time complexity of the algorithm used to find the path.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Constraints\n",
        "\n",
        "- The grid will have dimensions at most 50x50.\n",
        "- The energy values will be between 1 and 100.\n",
        "- There is at least one valid path for Beary to start his adventure.\n",
