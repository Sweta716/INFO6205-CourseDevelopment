    "### Problem: Forest Adventure with Beary\n",
    "\n",
    "Beary is on an adventure in a mystical forest filled with honey pots, obstacles, and magic paths. The forest is represented as a grid where each cell can be:\n",
    "- 'B' for Beary's starting position,\n",
    "- 'H' for honey pots,\n",
    "- 'O' for obstacles,\n",
    "- '.' for empty cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beary wants to collect all the honey pots and return to the starting point while avoiding obstacles. You need to help Beary find the shortest path that allows him to collect all honey pots and return home safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, there are magic paths in the forest that consume different amounts of energy based on their length. The forest grid is accompanied by another grid representing the energy required to traverse each path.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function Signature:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def find_shortest_path_with_energy(grid: List[List[str]], energy: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "- `grid`: A 2D list of characters representing the forest. Possible characters are 'B' (start), 'H' (honey pot), 'O' (obstacle), and '.' (empty cell).\n",
    "- `energy`: A 2D list of integers representing the energy required to traverse each cell in the forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "- An integer representing the minimum total energy required for Beary to collect all honey pots and return home. Return -1 if it's not possible to collect all honey pots and return.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "grid = [\n",
    "    ['B', '.', 'H'],\n",
    "    ['O', 'O', '.'],\n",
    "    ['H', '.', 'H']\n",
    "]\n",
    "energy = [\n",
    "    [1, 1, 2],\n",
    "    [3, 3, 1],\n",
    "    [1, 1, 1]\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "print(find_shortest_path_with_energy(grid, energy))  # Output: 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "- The grid will have at most 50x50 cells.\n",
    "- There will be at least one honey pot in the grid.\n",
    "- Energy values will be between 1 and 10^3.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "1. Implement the function to solve the problem.\n",
    "2. Analyze the time complexity of your solution.\n",
    "3. Discuss any optimization techniques you used to enhance the efficiency of your solution.\n"
