    "\n",
    "Beary wants to plant a row of flowers in the garden, with each flower having a specific color. However, he wants to avoid planting flowers of the same color next to each other to create a visually appealing pattern. Implement the `plantFlowers` function to arrange the flowers in the garden while minimizing the number of adjacent flowers with the same color.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function Signature:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def plantFlowers(flowers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input\n",
    "- `flowers`: A list of integers representing the colors of the flowers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "- Returns a list of integers representing the arranged flowers such that the number of adjacent flowers with the same color is minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "- The length of `flowers` will be at most 100.\n",
    "- The values in `flowers` will be between 1 and 100.\n",

    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Randomized Algorithm\n",
    "- Use a randomized algorithm to arrange the flowers such that the number of adjacent flowers with the same color is minimized.\n",
    "- Randomly shuffle the flowers and then use a heuristic to swap adjacent flowers of the same color.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "1. Randomly shuffle the list of flowers.\n",
    "2. Iterate through the list and swap adjacent flowers if they have the same color.\n",
    "3. Repeat step 2 until the number of adjacent flowers with the same color is minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Randomized Algorithm Works Here\n",
    "- The randomized approach helps in breaking initial patterns and providing a good starting point for the heuristic to work effectively.\n"
