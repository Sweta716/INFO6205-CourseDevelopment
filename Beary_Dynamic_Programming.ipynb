    "\n",
    "Beary discovers the Maze of Wisdom, a grid full of obstacles. To find the treasure, he must navigate from the top-left to the bottom-right corner, moving only right or down. The maze may place one new obstacle in his path after he starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Help Beary find the minimum number of steps to the treasure, considering the maze can add one obstacle to increase the challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function Signature:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def min_steps_to_treasure(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n",
    "    pass\n",

    "### Input\n",
    "- `grid`: A 2D list of integers where 0 represents an empty cell and 1 represents an obstacle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "- Returns an integer representing the minimum number of steps to the treasure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "- The grid will have dimensions at most 50x50.\n",
    "- The values in `grid` will be either 0 or 1.\n",
    "- There is at least one valid path for Beary to reach the treasure initially.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Dynamic Programming and BFS\n",
    "- Use a combination of dynamic programming and breadth-first search (BFS) to find the minimum number of steps to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid.\n",
    "- Create a BFS function to calculate the shortest path in the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "1. Initialize the BFS queue and visited set.\n",
    "2. Traverse the grid using BFS to find the shortest path to the treasure.\n",
    "3. Record the minimum steps to reach the treasure without any additional obstacle.\n",
    "4. Simulate placing an obstacle in each empty cell and recalculate the minimum steps using BFS.\n",
    "5. Track the minimum steps across all simulations.\n",
    "6. Return the minimum steps found.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why BFS Works Here\n",
    "- BFS is used to explore all possible paths in an unweighted grid, ensuring the shortest path is found.\n",
    "- Dynamic programming helps store and reuse calculations for paths, making the solution efficient.\n"
