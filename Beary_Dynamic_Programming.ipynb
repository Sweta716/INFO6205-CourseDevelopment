    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Beary discovers the Maze of Wisdom, a grid full of obstacles. To find the treasure, he must navigate from the top-left to the bottom-right corner, moving only right or down. The maze may place one new obstacle in his path after he starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Help Beary find the minimum number of steps to the treasure, considering the maze can add one obstacle to increase the challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function Signature:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def min_steps_to_treasure(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input\n",
    "- `grid`: A 2D list of integers where 0 represents an empty cell and 1 represents an obstacle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "- Returns an integer representing the minimum number of steps to the treasure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "- The grid will have dimensions at most 50x50.\n",
    "- The values in `grid` will be either 0 or 1.\n",
    "- There is at least one valid path for Beary to reach the treasure initially.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic Programming\n",
    "- Use dynamic programming to find the minimum number of steps to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid.\n",
    "- Create a DP table where each cell represents the minimum number of steps required to reach that cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "1. Initialize a DP table with the same dimensions as the grid.\n",
    "2. Set the starting point at the top-left corner of the grid.\n",
    "3. Iterate through the grid and update the DP table based on the minimum steps required to reach each cell.\n",
    "4. Add one obstacle to the grid and recalculate the minimum steps.\n",
    "5. Return the value at the bottom-right corner of the DP table as the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Dynamic Programming Works Here\n",
    "- The dynamic programming approach works because we can break down the problem into smaller sub-problems and use memoization to remember past decisions.\n"
