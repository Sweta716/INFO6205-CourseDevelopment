    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Embark on a mapping and exploration mission in the Wild Woods, depicted as a directed graph with points of interest as nodes and pathways as edges. Your mission involves using graph theory to chart the area, establish efficient routes, and discover hidden secrets. This adventure requires strategic planning and smart navigation to connect all points of interest and successfully navigate the woods' challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks:\n",
    "1. **Graph Traversal**: Implement both Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore the graph.\n",
    "2. **Cycle Detection**: Implement an algorithm to detect cycles in the directed graph.\n",
    "3. **Topological Sorting**: Implement topological sorting for the directed graph if it's a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function Signatures:**\n",

    "- Use Kahn's algorithm or a modified DFS to produce a topological ordering of the nodes if the graph is a DAG.\n",
