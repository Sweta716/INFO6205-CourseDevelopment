    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Berry the Bear, renowned for his wisdom in the woodland, plans a grand feast inviting all forest dwellers. The seating arrangement at the feast table poses a unique challenge: each guest has a list of preferred neighbors, and so does each seat at the table, based on the view or proximity to the food.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the Gale-Shapley algorithm to solve the stable matching problem efficiently, ensuring a harmonious dining experience by optimally matching guests to seats, respecting preferences on both sides.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function Signature:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def stable_matching(guests: List[List[int]], seats: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input\n",
    "- `guests`: A list of lists where each sublist represents the preferences of a guest.\n",
    "- `seats`: A list of lists where each sublist represents the preferences of a seat.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "- Returns a list where the i-th element is the seat assigned to the i-th guest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "- The number of guests and seats are equal, and each is at most 100.\n",
    "- Each guest and seat have a complete preference list.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Gale-Shapley Algorithm\n",
    "- Use the Gale-Shapley algorithm to find a stable matching.\n",
    "- Each guest and seat have a list of preferences. Use these to determine the matches.\n",
    "- Ensure that no guest and seat would prefer each other over their current match.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "1. Initialize all guests and seats as free.\n",
    "2. While there is a free guest who hasn't proposed to every seat:\n",
    "    1. Choose such a guest.\n",
    "    2. The guest proposes to the seat they prefer the most among the ones they haven't proposed to.\n",
    "    3. If the seat is free, they become matched.\n",
    "    4. If the seat is not free and prefers this guest over their current match, they switch.\n",
    "    5. Otherwise, the guest remains free and proposes to the next seat on their list.\n"
